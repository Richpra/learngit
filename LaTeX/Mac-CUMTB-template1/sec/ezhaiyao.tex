Using self-developed visible experimental installation, the influences of surfactant Tween (T40, 1×10-3mol/L; T40, 2×10-3mol/L; T40/T80(1:1), 1×10-3mol/L) on the process of gas hydration were studied. Combined with the field study of adding surfactant R1-89 for coal seam water infusion with high pressure, the essential roles of surfactant in three stages of gas hydration were analyzed. The results indicate that in the stage of coal seam water infusion, the surfactant decreases the surface tension of liquid and the pressure of water infusion, quickens the rate of water infusion, and coal is dabbled uniformly; in the stage of gas hydrate induction, the micelle agglomeration of surfactant can increase the solubility of gas, accelerate the supersaturation of gas in solution, prompt the formation of crystal nucleus of gas hydrate, and the induction time is shortened; in the stage of gas hydrate growth, the binding effect of surfactant micelle on gas molecule dissolved in it and water molecule absorbed around it is equivalent to the reduction of systems’ temperature, so the thermodynamic conditions of gas hydrate formation are changed.
